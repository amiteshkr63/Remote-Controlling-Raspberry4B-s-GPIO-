### Hosting Webpage on Raspberry via installing Apache web Server on Raspberry Pi 4B

First step:
ssh to your raspberry pi followed by your password.

```ssh pi@192.168.29.45```

syntax:

```ssh <your pi user name>@<your pi ip address>```

commands:

To make insure that you have latest software package

```sudo apt update```

To ugrade the software apache

```sudo apt upgrade```

To install apache2

```sudo apt install apache2```

To check the status of apache2

```systemctl status apache2```

check if it installed OK

default config file for apache2 is at: ```/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf```

To view this file
```vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf```

To check the root of your website in
check ```DocumentRoot``` in 

```/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file```

this contains some default website files here

Generally ```/var/www/html```

Goto this directory

```cd /var/www/html```

```ls -la```

generally contains ```index.html```

here only root user can access index.html

so to change ownership, for only html file directory we use cmmnd:

```sudo chown pi:pi .```

if you dont want to change ownership

then, everytime you have to use "sudo" to do anything with this file

Then,

```rm index.html```

then, 

```ls``` 

to check it is removed

then, cut-copy paste your desired html file to index.html

```vi index.html```
